# API-WebApps
This web app currently houses 2 different APIs from Giphy.com and OpenWeatherMap.com. Following Joshua Fluke's Giphy API tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-91UA-Xy2Cvb98deRXuggA) I styled the html pages to add my own spin on it. 

Giphy will return 30 gifs that the user searches for, and Open Weather Map returns current weather temp and condition based on US zipcode.
